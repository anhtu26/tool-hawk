# 3.5 Part History Tracking

## Usage Record Structure

The Part History Tracking system maintains a comprehensive record of tool usage throughout the manufacturing process, creating a valuable data trail that connects tools to specific jobs and parts. This system captures detailed information about when, where, by whom, and for what purpose each tool was used, supporting both operational accountability and analytical insights.

The usage record structure is designed to capture all relevant aspects of tool utilization, including:

- **Usage ID**: A unique identifier for the usage record, automatically generated by the system.

- **Tool ID**: A reference to the specific tool that was used, linking the usage record to the tool's master record.

- **Job Number**: The identifier for the manufacturing job for which the tool was used. This typically corresponds to a work order or production run in the shop's job tracking system.

- **Part Number**: The identifier for the specific part being manufactured. A single job may involve multiple part numbers, and this field allows for more granular tracking of tool usage.

- **User ID**: A reference to the user who used the tool, typically the machine operator or setup technician. This creates accountability and enables analysis of tool usage patterns by individual.

- **Usage Date**: The date and time when the tool was used or checked out from inventory.

- **Quantity Used**: The number of tool units consumed or checked out in this usage instance.

- **Total Tool Used**: A free-text field allowing users to provide additional context about tool usage, such as "Used 3 inches of 12-inch bar" or "Consumed 2 of 10 inserts."

- **Return Date**: An optional field recording when the tool was returned to inventory, if applicable. This is relevant for reusable tools that are checked out temporarily.

- **Notes**: Additional free-text information about the usage, such as special setup conditions, performance observations, or quality issues.

- **Created By**: The user who created the usage record (which may differ from the user who used the tool, particularly for retrospective record creation).

- **Creation Date**: The date and time when the usage record was created in the system.

- **Last Updated**: The date and time when the usage record was last modified.

This comprehensive data structure ensures that all relevant information about tool usage is captured and preserved, supporting both operational needs (tracking where tools are being used) and analytical functions (understanding usage patterns and tool life).

## Job and Part Number Tracking

The Job and Part Number Tracking functionality is a critical component of the Part History system, establishing the connection between tools and the manufacturing operations they support. This functionality enables users to associate tool usage with specific production activities, creating a bidirectional traceability that benefits both tool management and production tracking.

### Job Number Structure

Job numbers represent distinct manufacturing projects or production runs within the shop. The system accommodates various job numbering conventions:

1. **Format Flexibility**: The system accepts job numbers in whatever format the organization uses, without imposing a specific structure. This ensures compatibility with existing job tracking systems and processes.

2. **Validation Options**: While maintaining flexibility, the system can optionally validate job number formats against configurable patterns if the organization has standardized conventions.

3. **Active Jobs**: The system can optionally integrate with job management systems to validate that entered job numbers correspond to active jobs, reducing data entry errors.

4. **Job Metadata**: When available, the system can display job metadata (customer, due date, priority) alongside the job number to help users verify they've selected the correct job.

### Part Number Structure

Part numbers identify specific components being manufactured within a job. Like job numbers, the system accommodates various part numbering conventions:

1. **Format Flexibility**: The system accepts part numbers in whatever format the organization uses, supporting both internal part numbering systems and customer-provided identifiers.

2. **Job-Part Relationship**: The system recognizes that multiple part numbers may be associated with a single job, and the same part number may appear across different jobs.

3. **Part Metadata**: When available, the system can display part metadata (description, material, revision) alongside the part number to help users verify they've selected the correct part.

4. **Drawing References**: For organizations that link part numbers to technical drawings, the system can optionally store or reference drawing numbers alongside part numbers.

### Job/Part Caching

To improve efficiency during tool check-out operations, the system implements a job/part caching mechanism:

1. **Daily User Cache**: When a user checks out a tool for the first time in a day, they are prompted to enter the job number and part number they're working on.

2. **Persistent Cache**: This information is stored in a server-side cache associated with the user's ID and the current date.

3. **Automatic Reuse**: For subsequent check-outs by the same user on the same day, the system automatically retrieves the cached job and part information, eliminating repetitive data entry.

4. **Override Option**: Users can override the cached values when needed, such as when switching to a different job or part during their shift.

5. **Cache Expiration**: The cache automatically expires at the end of the day, ensuring that users working across multiple days must re-confirm their job and part information.

### Job/Part Search and Filtering

The system provides robust capabilities for finding tools based on their association with jobs and parts:

1. **Job-Based Search**: Users can search for all tools used on a specific job, helping with job costing, troubleshooting, and process improvement.

2. **Part-Based Search**: Users can search for all tools used to manufacture a specific part, supporting process standardization and tool selection optimization.

3. **Date-Range Filtering**: Searches can be constrained to specific time periods, such as finding all tools used for a particular job in the last month.

4. **User Filtering**: Searches can be filtered by user, such as finding all tools used by a specific operator for a particular job.

5. **Tool Category Filtering**: Within job or part searches, results can be further filtered by tool category, such as finding all endmills used for a specific part.

### Job/Part Analytics

The system leverages job and part tracking data to provide valuable insights:

1. **Tool Usage by Job**: Analysis of which tools are most frequently used for specific jobs, helping with job setup planning and tool inventory optimization.

2. **Tool Consumption by Part**: Analysis of tool consumption rates for specific parts, supporting accurate job costing and tool life expectations.
