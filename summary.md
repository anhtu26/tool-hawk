# 1. Executive Summary

## Purpose and Scope

The CNC Machine Shop Tool Library Web Application is designed to digitally manage and track the complete lifecycle of tooling inventory within a CNC machine shop environment. This comprehensive system aims to replace manual, paper-based processes with a streamlined digital solution that provides real-time visibility into tool inventory, usage patterns, purchase history, and maintenance requirements. The application will serve as a centralized repository for all tool-related information, enabling efficient tool management, reducing downtime due to missing tools, and optimizing procurement processes.

The scope of this application encompasses the complete management of CNC tooling from acquisition to retirement, including categorization with custom attributes, inventory tracking, usage history by job and part number, purchase record maintenance, and reporting capabilities. The system will support multiple user roles with varying levels of access and permissions, ensuring proper data governance while facilitating collaboration among shop personnel.

## Target Users

The CNC Machine Shop Tool Library Web Application is designed for three primary user roles:

1. Administrators: Shop managers or IT personnel responsible for system configuration, user management, and overall system governance. These users require full access to all system features, including the ability to create and modify tool categories, manage users, and configure system settings.

2. Managers: Shop supervisors or lead machinists who oversee tool inventory, approve purchases, and manage tool categories. These users need comprehensive access to tool management features, including the ability to add, modify, and delete tools, create and edit tool categories, and generate reports.

3. Users: Machine operators, setup technicians, and other shop floor personnel who need to check out tools, record tool usage, and search for available tools. These users require limited access focused on day-to-day tool usage and basic inventory management tasks.

The application is designed primarily for desktop use in shop or office environments, with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and ease of use for technical personnel who may have varying levels of computer proficiency.

## Business Objectives

The implementation of the CNC Machine Shop Tool Library Web Application aims to achieve several key business objectives:

1. Reduce tool-related downtime by providing real-time visibility into tool inventory and location, enabling proactive procurement before stock depletion.

2. Optimize tool inventory levels by tracking usage patterns and establishing appropriate minimum stock thresholds, reducing both stockouts and excess inventory.

3. Improve accountability for tool usage through comprehensive tracking of who used which tools for specific jobs and parts.

4. Enhance procurement efficiency by maintaining detailed purchase history, vendor information, and lead times for each tool.

5. Support data-driven decision making through robust reporting and export capabilities that provide insights into tool usage, costs, and inventory status.

6. Ensure compliance with industry regulations by maintaining detailed records of tool acquisition, usage, and disposal, particularly important for ITAR compliance.

7. Increase overall shop productivity by streamlining tool management processes and reducing time spent searching for or replacing missing tools.

## Key Features Overview

The CNC Machine Shop Tool Library Web Application will include the following key features:

1. Role-based authorization system with three distinct user roles (admin, manager, user), each with appropriate permissions and access controls.

2. Dynamic tool categorization system allowing for the creation of custom categories (e.g., Endmill, Drill, Tap) with category-specific attributes while maintaining standard fields across all tools.

3. Comprehensive tool management with detailed tool information pages displaying both fixed and category-specific attributes.

4. Purchase history tracking with the ability to attach and store relevant documentation such as quotes and purchase orders.

5. Part history tracking to record tool usage by job number, part number, and user.

6. Streamlined tool check-out functionality with intelligent caching of job and part information to reduce repetitive data entry.

7. Powerful search capabilities allowing users to find tools by tool number, job number, or part number.

8. Advanced filtering system enabling users to filter tools based on category-specific attributes, including numerical ranges.

9. Flexible export functionality supporting various data export formats and selection criteria.

10. Dashboard with low inventory alerts to proactively identify tools that need replenishment.

11. Secure authentication using JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing.

12. Modern, intuitive user interface built with React, Vite, and shadcn/ui components.

This application represents a significant advancement in tool management capabilities for CNC machine shops, combining robust data management with an intuitive user experience to deliver substantial operational improvements and cost savings.
